## Estimating the risk of developing OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma) by quantifying salivary biomarker levels
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of oral cancer. Since medical infrastructure is unaffordable to most of our society, an urgent and effective diagnostic tool is needed at present. Our kit, OSCCit aims at detecting the levels of salivary protease biomarkers that are elevated among OSCC patients. It then assesses the risk one has of developing OSCC and might suggest the user to visit a doctor. OSCCit contains an engineered bacterial cage protein - Encapsulin that has fluorophores internally and a substrate sequence externally. When protease biomarkers cleave the latter, fluorescence occurs. This characteristic emission frequency allows us to verify the presence of the protease and estimate its concentration through the emission intensity. Protease biomarkers maintain their activity, giving us the advantage of working directly with a patientâ€™s saliva without any processing. Additionally, 3D printed hardware parts ensure the kit can be used with a smartphone.
